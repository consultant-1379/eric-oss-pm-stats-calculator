                    The Mutiny Appliance provides a Web Frontend, where the users can configure the system and monitor the data collected by the appliance. The Frontend provides a “Documents” section/tab, where multiple weaknesses have been detected allowing to delete any file from the remote file system with root privileges, to copy and move files etc.
                    Vulnerability is originating from Wildfly.
                    The vulnerable part of the application resides in io.smallrye.reactive.mutiny.* Wildfly module, which is loaded on demand. Wildfly configuration in PM Stats Calculator does not load this module.
            mitigation: >-

                rationale: >-
                    This vulnerability makes it possible to exploit deserialization of untrusted data, ultimately leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
                    Vulnerability originates from org.springframework:spring-web package.
                    The root cause is the readRemoteInvocation method within the HttpInvokerServiceExporter.class does not sufficiently restrict or verify untrusted objects prior to deserializing them.
                    PM Stats Calculator is not using this functionality since exposed endpoints are only used by other microservices.
